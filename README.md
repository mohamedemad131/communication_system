generating some line codes in communication system and make some processing to them
matlab code for generation random data for three different line code in communication system and make some processing to them 
like : how to find
first how to generate the different line codes thin finding :
1-static mean
2-time mean
3-static autocorrelation
4-time autocorrelation
5-PSD
